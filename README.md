Implementations of the lox and jack programming languages in python


- Jack Scanner 🚧
- Jack Parser ❌ TODO
- Lox Scanner ✅
- Lox Parser 🚧



# TODO

- folder reading logic
    - if invoked as
        - `py_jack scanner file.jack` - scans only that file
        - `py_jack scanner` looks at current directory and looks for `*.jack` files and outputs `*T.xml` representations
        - `py_jack parser` has the basically the same behavior as `scanner`
            - `py_jack parser` output file names should be `*.xml`
