Implementations of the lox and jack programming languages in python


- Jack Scanner âœ…
- Jack Parser âœ…
- Lox Scanner âœ…
- Lox Parser ðŸš§ wip



# TODO

- folder reading logic
    - if invoked as
        - `py_jack scanner file.jack` - scans only that file
        - `py_jack scanner` looks at current directory and looks for `*.jack` files and outputs `*T.xml` representations
        - `py_jack parser` has the basically the same behavior as `scanner`
            - `py_jack parser` output file names should be `*.xml`
